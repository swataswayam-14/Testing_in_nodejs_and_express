# Testing MERN Stack with Jest and Vitest

This repository contains examples of implementing tests using Jest and Vitest for a MERN stack application and a simple Express server. It also demonstrates the use of the Supertest module for making HTTP requests during testing and the `vitest-mock-extended` library for mocking database calls.

## Folders

1. `testing-mern-jest`: Contains tests for a MERN stack application using Jest.
2. `testing-mern-vitest`: Contains tests for a MERN stack application using Vitest.
3. `testing-simple-app`: Contains tests for a simple Express server that performs addition operations.

## Technologies Used

- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework for unit tests.
- Vitest: A fast and powerful testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- Supertest: A library for testing HTTP servers using a fluent API.
- `vitest-mock-extended`: A library for mocking TypeScript types with Vitest.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js used in the simple http server.
